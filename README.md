THIS PROJECT WAS BUILT USING THE ANGULAR FRAMEWORK, AND INCLUDES AN APPLET OF GAME WE BUILT IN JAVA, A VERSION HISTORY PAGE FOR THAT
GAME, AND A RANDOM API PAGE THAT IS THERE FOR THE FUN OF IT.

A FEW NOTES ABOUT THE PROJECT, IF ng server DOES NOT WORK AFTER INSTALLATION OF npm install THEN RUN npm install @angular/core AGAIN.
FOR SOME REASON IT SEEMS TO ONLY WORK IF THERE IS BOTH A LOCAL AND GLOBAL VERSION OF ANGULAR INSTALLED ON THE COMPUTER.

ALSO THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE IMAGES AND OTHER PAGE DETERMINED FEATURES MAY (PROBABLY NOT THOUGH BECAUSE WE FIXED THAT BUG I BELIEVE)
BUT THEY MAY NOT WORK. IF THIS IS THE CASE, REMOVE THEM FROM THE ASSETS FOLDER, RESTART THE SERVER, AND PLACE THEM BACK AGAIN. THIS
SEEMS TO WORK FOR SOME WEIRD REASON.
